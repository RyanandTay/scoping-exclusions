Please write me a good README.md for this VBA project. Project Overview — summarize the purpose and business context in plain English.*  Features — bullet points of what the macro automates and why it’s valuable.*  How It Works — explain the key logic of the macro (e.g., matching exclusions, highlighting, totals).*  Setup Instructions — explain how to enable macros, how to use the green and gray buttons, and any assumptions about workbook structure (tabs like “Original Data,” “Input,” and “Scoping”).*  Usage Steps — step-by-step how a user should run the macro.*  Reset Functionality — describe the “Clean Scoping” button.*  File Structure — short note about what each sheet represents.*  Code Structure (for Developers) — describe the two main subs (Scoping_Exclusions and Clean_Scoping), constants, and logic highlights.*  Explain scoping component – It may not be obvious to a user what a scoping component is. Explain this and explain that a business segment is one of three high level organizations and say what they are and why they are combined with region to get scoping component. *  Screenshots — insert <!-- TODO: add screenshot of ... --> comments in the README where screenshots should go.Here is additional info for you about the project:Please look at the excel file in the directory and leave me comments where I should add screenshots.The idea behind the project is that the company’s total financial data is aggregated into a large dataset by FSLI, Business Unit, and Scoping component (which is the combination of the Region and the Business Segment. This data is included on the “Original Data” tab. Business Segments include consulting, facilities, and investments. Throughout the quarter, internal audit senior management consults with external auditors and the CFO to determine FSLIs that should be excluded from audit testing for various Business Units. The list of exclusions is constantly revised and added upon during the quarter. This list is represented on the “Input” tab. At quarter end, management builds out a pivot table from the Original Data and puts it on the “Scoping” tab. The purpose of the macro is to take the list of exclusions and highlight each cell in the pivot table that matches. This formatting is very important as it is the way management wants to look at the data. The program also needs to add the total FSLI exclusions (highlighted cells) per row and add a column after the pivot table showing these totals. This is important to automate because the list may even be updated multiple times after quarter end based on discussions with compliance professionals, causing lines to be added or removed. Before using the macro, a team member had to manually update the list each time changes were made, resulting in significant inefficiency.The large green button can be pressed to run the macro. It asks for the row where the income statement rows start because sometimes management wants to exclude all balance sheet or all income statement financial statement line items separately for a given business unit. This input allows the program to know the breakout of the different statements in the pivot table.Additionally, management may choose to exclude all FSLIs for a given business unit and scoping component combination. The program logic allows for this as well.Finally, the smaller button allows the highlighting and added columns to be deleted, effectively resetting the pivot table from the effect of the macro.
